# FileNameExtensionManipulation

This is a POC to the production issue and it's resolution while making use of System.IO, FilePath and Regex. 
The POC demonstrates different strategies of how one filename extension can be manipulated whenever some invalid character present in it making the filename throwing unpleasant exception while performing some operation on top of it.
This repo showcases the possible solutions around some edge case scenarios to prevent unwanted and unintended run-time exception while application is being served to client under production. 


# Happy Coding. :)
